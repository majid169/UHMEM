This is a naive tracer for UHMEM. 
It uses a simple direct cache to filter out all accesses getting hit on chip, and collects the traces on miss. 

TODO:
1- Collecting PA not VA
2- Simpoints
3- Manual says that each row is Instruction-address of read--address of write.
    I do not knwo how we can have a read and a write at the same time.

How to Use:
pin -t allcache.so -s [# instructions to fast-forward] -t [# instructions to collect] -- /bin/ls
